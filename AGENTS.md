# AGENTS.md

## Commit conventions

- Commits must be signed off (`Signed-off-by:` trailer) **by the human**. Agents must never add a `Signed-off-by:` trailer on the human's behalf — the DCO sign-off is an attestation only the human can make.
- Agents must include an `Assisted-by:` trailer identifying the agent and model.
- Order trailers as: `Assisted-by:` first, then the human's `Signed-off-by:` last (added by the human).

Format:

```
Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION
```

- `AGENT_NAME` — the AI tool or framework (e.g. `claude-code`, `opencode`, `codex`, `pi`, …).
- `MODEL_VERSION` — the specific model version used (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5.5`).

Example:

```
Assisted-by: opencode:gpt-5.5
```

Other commit rules:

- Commit messages must be ASCII only.
- Keep PRs small and focused; don't mix trivial and controversial changes.
- Squash into logical commits (API / docs / CLI / daemon / tests / CI) for non-trivial PRs.
- Maintain a linear git history.
